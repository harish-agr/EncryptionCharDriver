This is my second assignment for Operating Systems Design 198:416

The purpose of this project was to familiarize students with creating and implementing Character Drivers. We created a Control Device cryptctl to create encryption and decryption subdrivers through ioctl() calls. Details about the assignment can be found in assignment.pdf

To insert the cryptctl device we assume the user has root privileges and has run the Makefile.
You can call:
     "insmod cryptctl.ko" to insert the device to /dev/cryptctl
     "rmmod cryptctl.ko" to remove the device from /dev
To add the encryption/decryption subdrivers users should work with the "app" program created with the Makefile.
     "./app" will provide an explanation about how it can be used

For further details about using the "app" program or about the Char Driver's implementation refer to report.pdf
